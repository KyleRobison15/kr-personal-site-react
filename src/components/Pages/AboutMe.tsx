          I'm a software engineer with over two years of experience building
          modern full stack web applications. I specialize in developing RESTful
          web services using Java and Spring and have experience with both
          NoSQL, document-based databases like MongoDB and more traditional
          relational databases like MySQL. On the front end, I excel at building
          dynamic user interfaces with React, Javascript and Typescript, and I
          make them shine with sound CSS fundamentals. My experience
          encapsulates the entire software development lifecycle and showcases a
          commitment to producing innovative and reliable solutions for the end
          user. I love what I do, and I'm always open to new opportunities, so
          if you're working on something cool and need a passionate developer,
          I'd love the chance to earn a spot on your team!
